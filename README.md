**1.Introduction**
AutoTrader is one of the UK's largest automotive marketplaces, enabling buying and selling of new and used vehicles. This project aims to clean and preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and build predictive models to estimate car prices.

**2.Data Processing**
Handling Missing Values
Missing values in columns like reg_code and year_of_registration were filled using logical assumptions and historical norms.
Remaining missing values were imputed using the mode.
Dealing with Outliers and Noise
Excluded cars outside the 1892–2021 year range.
Applied logarithmic transformations to mileage and price to normalize distributions.

**3.Feature Engineering**
Derived Features
Created Age from year_of_registration.
Classified cars into Car_type (new, used, vintage).
Combined Standard_make and Standard_model into Make_Model.
Consolidated infrequent Standard_colour values into an other category.

**4. Feature Selection**
Consolidated and transformed features to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.
Categorical variables were encoded using techniques like target encoding and one-hot encoding.
Applied MinMaxScaler for numerical features.

**5. Model Building**

**Linear Regression**
Evaluated using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².
Polynomial regression applied to capture non-linear relationships.

**Boosting Tree (XGBoost)**
Incorporated XGBoost for its efficiency and handling of large datasets.
Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.

**Random Forest Regressor**
Utilized Random Forest for robust regression tasks.
Employed grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

**Stacking Ensemble**
Combined Linear Regression and XGBoost using a stacking ensemble to improve accuracy, especially for vintage cars.

**6.Evaluation**
**Cross-Validation**
Performed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization and robustness.
**Feature Importance**
Used SHAP values and partial dependency plots to interpret feature importance and their effects on predictions.
**7. Results**
The XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance with high R² and low MAE and MSE values.
Stacking ensemble improved predictions for vintage cars by combining linear and non-linear models.

**8. Conclusion**
Accurate predictions were achieved through careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
Future improvements can include additional features capturing car condition, rarity, and historical value for vintage cars.
